# MasiveDataManager

- On this project we will be working on a way to handle masive ammounts of data while it is moved between data bases and pyhton modules. 
- The idea is to symulate the BE of an application that handles the reservation and cancels of tickets from a list of sport stadiums.
- Eventually the applicattion will allow you to configure your own "stadium". 

Analyzing the speed and the number of data we can control is the main purpose of this project. For the developing part we will be using some packages such as random, pymysql... (More to be added).
